      "- The statue stands at a height of 305 feet (including the pedestal) and is made of copper sheets mounted on a steel framework. It was the tallest iron structure ever built when it was completed.\n",
      "- Visitors can access the statue and its pedestal via ferry, where they can explore the statue's museum, enjoy panoramic views of New York City from the pedestal, and even climb up to the crown for a close-up view of the statue's interior and a spectacular view of the city.\n",
